# OnTrack - Time Tracker
An easy to use time tracker and hours logger made with [**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev). This versatile app allows users to easily log hours and keep track of their progress. It also uses [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com) so it can store a daily record of the users activity which can be accessed on any device by just logging in to the associated account.
